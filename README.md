# CPU SCHEDULER - First Come First Serve

The goal of this project is to implement the First Come First Serve Algorithm. With this algorithm, the CPU is allocated to the processes in the order they request it.

## Getting Started

Launch the FCFS.html document to open the simulator.

### Prerequisites

--Must have access to an internet browser.
	*Google Chrome is recommended*


## Running the tests

1. Enter the number of desired processes to allocate into the CPU into the corresponding input field. 
	**NOTE: This program allows a max of 10 processes at a time**
2. Press the 'Insert' button to generate the amount of processes previously specified.
3. Assign a burst time (in milliseconds) to each process in the corresponding input field.
	**NOTE: If random burst times are desired, click the 'RANDOMIZE TIMES' button. Random burst times are assigned a value between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive)**
4. Once all processes are assigned a burst time, click the 'RUN' button to execute the algorithm.
5. Upon completion, a Gantt Chart will be constructed based on the prior input. In addition, the average waiting time and average turnaroud time is calculated.
	**NOTE: Due to varying screen size, you may need to scroll down the page to view the chart and calculated time**
6. If you wish to reset the page to its original state, click the 'START OVER' button.
